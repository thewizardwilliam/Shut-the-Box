# Shut-the-Box
Shut the box is an English pub gambling game. The objective is to roll the dice and knock down all of the tiles, which are labeled from one to nine. 
Two dice are rolled as long as the sum of all remaining tiles is greater than six. Once it is six or less, only one die is rolled. 
The current code is incredibly basic, but I'm looking to expand it into some CSS and add more JavaScript. No specefic rules are programmed yet, so you could potentially cheat uncaught. Once Shut the Box v2 is posted, I will cover all new updates.
