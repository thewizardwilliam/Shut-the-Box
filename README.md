# Shut-the-Box
Shut the box is an English pub gambling game. The objective is to roll the dice and knock down all of the tiles, which are labeled from one to nine. 
The current code is incredibly basic, but I'm looking to espand into some CSS and more JavaScript. No specefic rules are programmed yet, so you could potentially cheat uncaught.
